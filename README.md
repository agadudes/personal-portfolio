# Project no. 1
### **Topics:** HTML, CSS & Javascript

## **Title:** Personal Portfolio Version 1.0

**Description:** This is my first project in a series of many to redevelop my web development abilities that have been lying dormant for almost a decade.
The goal of these projects is to redevelop my ability to use CSS in creating web pages, as well keeping up to date with newer technologies that have emerged
since I last practiced web development.

For this first project, my goal is to develop a portfolio page for myself, which will serve as a hub for my other projects, pages and the like.

My *challenges* for this project in particular is to develop a portfolio that meets the following requirements:
+ Utilizes barebones HTML and CSS as much as possible. This is for this particular web page to render in most browsers with as little issues as possible.
+ Have *some* interactivty with little to no Javascript. Since I want this page to render everywhere, I will try to use no javascript to implement features.
+ The entire webpage must be responsive. The webpage must render neatly in most orientations and screens, thus using responsive units is almost always mandatory.
